# Life Events Intelligence Tool - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 **Concept: Life-Aware Financial AI**

Transform Juno from a pure financial calculator into a **life-aware financial companion** that understands major life events and their financial implications.

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture: Gemini-Driven Tool Selection**

### **Current Multi-User Architecture** ✅
```
Firebase User A
├── Fi User 1010101010 (isolated chat + life events)
├── Fi User 1111111111 (isolated chat + life events)
├── ...
└── Fi User 9999999999 (isolated chat + life events)

Firebase User B
├── Fi User 1010101010 (completely separate from User A)
├── ...
```

### **Enhanced Tool Flow** 🚀
```
User Query → Coordinator → RAG Context → Gemini with Tools:
                                       ├── Fi Tools (existing)
                                       └── Life Events Tool (NEW)
```

**Gemini Intelligence**: Let Gemini decide when life context is needed based on query understanding, not hardcoded triggers.

---

## 🛠️ **Tool Implementation**

### **1. New Context Agent MCP Tool**

**Tool Name**: `manage_life_events`

**Description**: 
```
Detect, collect, and manage user life events that impact financial decisions. 
This tool helps provide contextually relevant financial advice by understanding 
major life transitions, family situations, career changes, and future plans 
beyond pure financial data.
```

**Gemini Function Declaration**:
```json
{
  "name": "manage_life_events",
  "description": "Collect and manage user life events and future plans that significantly impact financial decisions. Use when major purchase decisions, long-term planning, or life transitions are discussed.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query_context": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "The financial query or decision being discussed"
      },
      "action": {
        "type": "string", 
        "enum": ["detect_events", "collect_new_event", "update_event", "get_relevant_events"],
        "description": "Action to perform with life events"
      },
      "event_details": {
        "type": "object",
        "description": "Life event details if collecting/updating",
        "properties": {
          "event_type": {"type": "string"},
          "timeline": {"type": "string"}, 
          "financial_impact": {"type": "string"},
          "description": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    },
    "required": ["query_context", "action"]
  }
}
```

### **2. When Gemini Should Call This Tool**

**Gemini's Intelligence** will determine when to call based on:
- Major purchase decisions (home, vehicle, expensive items)
- Questions about affordability beyond current numbers
- Long-term financial planning queries
- Mentions of family, career, or life changes
- Investment timeline discussions
- Risk tolerance or goal-setting conversations

**No hardcoded triggers** - let Gemini understand context naturally!

## 📊 **Firestore Schema: Life Events Collection**

### **Path Structure** (matching existing pattern):
```
users/{firebaseUID}/fi_users/{fiUserId}/life_events/{eventId}
```

### **Document Schema**:

## 🎨 **User Experience Design**

### **Smart Life Context Collection**

When Gemini detects need for life context:

**Approach 1: Conversational Discovery**
```
"I'd love to give you more personalized advice! For a big decision like buying a ₹30 lakh apartment, it helps to understand what else is happening in your life.

Are there any major life events or plans coming up that might impact this decision? For example:
• Getting married or family changes?
• Job transitions or career moves?
• Other major expenses planned?
• Timeline preferences?

This helps me give advice that fits your actual life, not just the numbers!"
```

**Approach 2: Contextual Questions**
```
"I see you're considering a ₹30 lakh apartment - that's exciting! To give you the best advice, could you share:

🕐 **Timeline**: When are you hoping to buy?
👥 **Life Stage**: Any major life changes coming up? (marriage, job change, family planning?)
💰 **Other Goals**: Any other significant expenses or investments planned?
🏠 **Context**: Is this your first home, upgrade, or investment property?

This context helps me tailor advice that actually fits your life!"
```

### **Life-Aware Response Examples**

**Without Life Context** (current):
```
"Based on your ₹17 lakh net worth, a ₹30 lakh apartment would require significant planning..."
```

**With Life Context** (enhanced):
```
"Based on your ₹17 lakh net worth AND your upcoming marriage in 6 months:

🎯 **Smart Strategy**: 
Since you're getting married soon, this becomes a joint financial decision. I'd recommend:

1. **Pre-Marriage**: Focus on wedding expenses (₹8L you mentioned)
2. **Post-Marriage**: Combine finances with your partner 
3. **Apartment Timeline**: Consider purchase 12-18 months post-wedding
4. **Joint Planning**: Partner's income/savings could change the entire equation

This approach aligns your dream home with your life transition! Would you like to explore joint financing options or discuss timeline adjustments?"
